title: "Traffic Violation Management System (Pascal)"
description: "This Pascal project implements a custom transit violations management system without external DB engines. Hybrid disk+RAM architecture with in-memory indexing using Binary Search Trees (BST) for O(log n) searches, binary file persistence with ABMC operations and logical deletes. Dynamic scoring system with automatic driver disabling based on recidivism. Skills: dynamic data structures (BST/linked lists), recursive algorithms, manual memory management with pointers, modular clean code architecture. Challenges: efficient indexing without frameworks, rehabilitation calculation from history, dynamic memory allocation in non-GC language."
