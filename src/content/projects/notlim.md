title: "Custom Language Compiler + Web Interpreter"
description: "NOTLIM-WEB is a full-stack web interpreter for a custom programming language, migrated from Pascal to TypeScript. Implements lexical analysis with Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), syntactic parsing with manual LL(1) predictive table-driven parser, and semantic evaluation via Tree-Walking Interpreter. Frontend uses React 19 with CodeMirror 6 for advanced editor, backend in Express 5 for secure execution. Skills: compiler theory (no ANTLR/LEX), Interpreter/Table-Driven Parser patterns, full-stack TypeScript development. Challenges: recursive algorithm migration to web, variable state management during execution, native matrix operations in a custom language with real/matrix types."
