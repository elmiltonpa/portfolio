title: "NextSpot — Geospatial Discovery App [in Progress]"
description: "NextSpot is a geospatial discovery platform using Next.js 16 and React 19. Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture for domain organization, Next.js Server Actions for type-safe mutations with PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. Integrates Google Maps Platform, NextAuth.js v5 for OAuth 2.0 auth, and Zod for end-to-end validation. Skills: performance optimization with RSC/optimistic UI, security via rate limiting/schema validation, shareable URL-as-state navigation. Challenges: 'Surprise Me' rating-based selection, massive geospatial data handling, minimal client-side JS with server rendering."
