title: "NextSpot — Geospatial Discovery App [in Progress]"
description: "NextSpot is a geospatial discovery platform built with Next.js (App Router) and React 19. It implements Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) for a modular and scalable architecture. Data integrity is handled via Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, using Next.js Server Actions for type-safe mutations and Zod for end-to-end validation.Key Features: OAuth 2.0 via NextAuth.js v5, Google Maps API integration, and performance-first rendering using RSC.Challenges: Implementing a rating-based 'Surprise Me' algorithm and optimizing server-side geospatial queries to minimize client-side JavaScript execution."
